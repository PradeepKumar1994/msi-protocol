# Instructions to run

The program takes three different types of input:

- [Read](#read)
- [Write](#write)
- [Status](#status)
- [Exit](#exit)

## Read

Based on the read instruction, you'll be prompted to input the memory location from main memory and the name of the processor.

## Write

The write instruction you'll be asked for processor name, memory block to write the data and the value to be written. 
It will be taking a string values, a number can be provided but the data type the program will be a string.

## Status

There two options inside status:

  1. Memory: will show you the data in the main memory
  2. Processor: Will list down all the processors along with the cache status and cache memory
  
These two options are only available if you enter the value for instruction.

#### NOTE: Any information from memory or processor, the options are listed every time the program waits for the input

## Exit

The instruction exit will exit from the running program.

Finally, I've uploaded the program to [GitHub](https://github.com/PradeepKumar1994/msi-protocol/)
